abstract = {We examine a simple relativistic theory of two scalar fields, first discussed by Goldstone, in which as a result of spontaneous breakdown of U(1) symmetry one of the scalar bosons is massless, in conformity with the Goldstone theorem. When the symmetry group of the Lagrangian is extended from global to local U(1) transformations by the introduction of coupling with a vector gauge field, the Goldstone boson becomes the longitudinal state of a massive vector boson whose transverse states are the quanta of the transverse gauge field. A perturbative treatment of the model is developed in which the major features of these phenomena are present in zero order. Transition amplitudes for decay and scattering processes are evaluated in lowest order, and it is shown that they may be obtained more directly from an equivalent Lagrangian in which the original symmetry is no longer manifest. When the system is coupled to other systems in a U(1) invariant Lagrangian, the other systems display an induced symmetry breakdown, associated with a partially conserved current which interacts with itself via the massive vector boson.},

abstract = {CMS is a general purpose experiment, designed to study the physics of pp collisions at 14 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It currently involves more than 2000 physicists from more than 150 institutes and 37 countries. The LHC will provide extraordinary opportunities for particle physics based on its unprecedented collision energy and luminosity when it begins operation in 2007. The principal aim of this report is to present the strategy of CMS to explore the rich physics programme offered by the LHC. This volume demonstrates the physics capability of the CMS experiment. The prime goals of CMS are to explore physics at the TeV scale and to study the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking—through the discovery of the Higgs particle or otherwise. To carry out this task, CMS must be prepared to search for new particles, such as the Higgs boson or supersymmetric partners of the Standard Model particles, from the start-up of the LHC since new physics at the TeV scale may manifest itself with modest data samples of the order of a few fb −1 or less. The analysis tools that have been developed are applied to study in great detail and with all the methodology of performing an analysis on CMS data specific benchmark processes upon which to gauge the performance of CMS. These processes cover several Higgs boson decay channels, the production and decay of new particles such as Z ' and supersymmetric particles, B s production and processes in heavy ion collisions. The simulation of these benchmark processes includes subtle effects such as possible detector miscalibration and misalignment. Besides these benchmark processes, the physics reach of CMS is studied for a large number of signatures arising in the Standard Model and also in theories beyond the Standard Model for integrated luminosities ranging from 1 fb −1 to 30 fb −1 . The Standard Model processes include QCD, B -physics, diffraction, detailed studies of the top quark properties, and electroweak physics topics such as the W and Z 0 boson properties. The production and decay of the Higgs particle is studied for many observable decays, and the precision with which the Higgs boson properties can be derived is determined. About ten different supersymmetry benchmark points are analysed using full simulation. The CMS discovery reach is evaluated in the parameter space covering a large variety of decay signatures. Furthermore, the discovery reach for a plethora of alternative models for new physics is explored, notably extra dimensions, new vector boson high mass states, little Higgs models, technicolour and others. Methods to discriminate between models have been investigated. This report is organized as follows. Chapter 1, the Introduction, describes the context of this document. Chapters 2–6 describe examples of full analyses, with photons, electrons, muons, jets, missing E T , B-mesons and $\tau$'s, and for quarkonia in heavy ion collisions. Chapters 7–15 describe the physics reach for Standard Model processes, Higgs discovery and searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model.},

The iron yoke of the flux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors covering most of the 4$\pi$ solid angle. Forward sampling calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values (|$\eta$| ≤ 5) assuring very good hermeticity.

abstract = {A discussion is given of the production, decay and observability of the scalar Higgs boson H expected in gauge theories of the weak and electromagnetic interactions such as the Weinberg-Salam model. After reviewing previous experimental limits on the mass of the Higgs boson, we give a speculative cosmological argument for a small mass. If its mass is similar to that of the pion, the Higgs boson may be visible in the reactions pi-p Hn or gammap Hp near threshold. If its mass is less, approximate300 MeV, the Higgs boson may be present in the decays of kaons with a branching ratio O(10-7), or in the decays of one of the new particles: 3.7 3.1 + H with a branching ratio O(10-4). If its mass is less-than-or-equals, slant4 GeV, the Higgs boson may be visible in the reaction pp H + X, H mu+mu-. If the Higgs boson has a mass less-than-or-equals, slant2mmu, the decays H e+e- and H gammagamma dominate, and the lifetime is O(6 10-4 to 2 10-12) seconds. As thresholds for heavier particles (pions, strange particles, new particles) are crossed, decays into them become dominant, and the lifetime decreases rapidly to O(10-20) sec for a Higgs boson of mass 10 GeV. Decay branching ratios in principle enable the quark masses to be determined.},

abstract = {The Higgs boson was postulated in 1964, and phenomenological studies of its possible production and decays started in the early 1970s, followed by studies of its possible production in e+ e-, pbar p and pp collisions, in particular. Until recently, the most sensitive searches for the Higgs boson were at LEP between 1989 and 2000, which have been complemented by searches at the Fermilab Tevatron. The LHC has recently entered the hunt, excluding a Higgs boson over a large range of masses and revealing a tantalizing hint in the range 119 to 125 GeV, and there are good prospects that the existence or otherwise of the Higgs boson will soon be established. One of the most attractive possibilities is that the Higgs boson is accompanied by supersymmetry, though composite options have yet to be excluded. This article reviews some of the key historical developments in Higgs physics over the past half-century.},

The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, gamma gamma and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3 0.4 (stat.) 0.5 (syst.) GeV.

abstract = {According to the Goldstone theorem, any manifestly covariant broken-symmetry theory must exhibit massless particles. However, it is known from previous work that such particles need not appear in a relativistic theory such as radiation-gauge electrodynamics, which lacks manifest covariance. Higgs has shown how the massless Goldstone particles may be eliminated from a theory with broken U(1) symmetry by coupling in the electromagnetic field. The primary purpose of this paper is to discuss the analogous problem for the case of broken non-Abelian gauge symmetries. In particular, a model is exhibited which shows how the number of massless particles in a theory of this type is determined, and the possibility of having a broken non-Abelian gauge symmetry with no massless particles whatever is established. A secondary purpose is to investigate the relationship between the radiation-gauge and Lorentz-gauge formalisms. The Abelian-gauge case is reexamined, in order to show that, contrary to some previous assertions, the Lorentz-gauge formalism, properly handled, is perfectly consistent, and leads to physical conclusions identical with those reached using the radiation gauge.},

abstract = {We combine results from the CDF and D0 Collaborations on direct searches for the standard model (SM) Higgs boson (H) in ppbar collisions at the Fermilab Tevatron at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV. Compared to the previous Tevatron Higgs boson search combination, more data have been included, additional channels have been incorporated, and some previously used channels have been reanalyzed to gain sensitivity. Searches are carried out for hypothesized Higgs boson masses between 100 and 200 GeV/c\^{}2. With up to 10 fb-1 of luminosity analyzed, the 95\% C.L. median expected upper limits on Higgs boson production are factors of 0.89, 1.08, and 0.48 times the values of the SM cross section for Higgs bosons of mass m\_H=115 GeV/c\^{}2, 125 GeV/c\^{}2, and 165 GeV/c\^{}2, respectively. In the absence of signal, we expect to exclude the regions 100<m\_\{H\}<120 GeV/c\^{}2 and 139<m\_H<184 GeV/c\^{}2. We exclude, at the 95\% CL, two regions: 100<m\_H<103 GeV/c\^{}2, and 147<m\_H<180 GeV/c\^{}2. There is a significant excess of data events with respect to the background estimation in the mass range 115<m\_H<140 GeV/c\^{}2, which causes our observed limits to not be as stringent as expected. At m\_H=120 GeV/c\^{}2, the p-value for a background fluctuation to produce this excess is $\backslash$sim1.5x10\^{}-3, corresponding to a local significance of 3.0 standard deviations. The global significance for such an excess anywhere in the full mass range investigated is approximately 2.5 standard deviations. We also combine separately searches for H to bb and H to WW. We find that the excess is concentrated in the H to bb channel, appearing in the searches over a broad range of m\_H. The maximum local significance of 3.2 standard deviations corresponds to a global significance of approximately 2.9 standard deviations. Our results in the H to WW channels are also consistent with the possible presence of a low-mass Higgs boson.},

abstract = {Being able to distinguish light-quark jets from gluon jets on an event-by-event basis could significantly enhance the reach for many new physics searches at the Large Hadron Collider. Through an exhaustive search of existing and novel jet substructure observables, we find that a multivariate approach can filter out over 95\% of the gluon jets while keeping more than half of the light-quark jets. Moreover, a combination of two simple variables, the charge track multiplicity and the \$p\_T\$-weighted linear radial moment (girth), can achieve similar results. While this pair appears very promising, our study is only Monte Carlo based, and other discriminants may work better with real data in a realistic experimental environment. To that end, we explore many other observables constructed using different jet sizes and parameters, and highlight those that deserve further theoretical and experimental scrutiny.

With only an isotopic triplet of leptons coupled to a triplet of vector bosons (two charged decay-intermediaries and the photon) the theory possesses no partial-symmetries.

Since the latter possibility yields a theory disagreeing with experiment, the simplest partially-symmetric model reproducing the observed electromagnetic and weak interactions of leptons requires the existence of at least four vector-boson fields (including the photon).

  abstract={We present a design for the Phase-1 upgrade of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) calorimeter trigger system composed of FPGAs and Multi-GBit/sec links that adhere to the μTCA crate Telecom standard. The upgrade calorimeter trigger will implement algorithms that create collections of isolated and non-isolated electromagnetic objects, isolated and non-isolated tau objects and jet objects. The algorithms are organized in several steps with progressive data reduction. These include a particle cluster finder that reconstructs overlapping clusters of 2x2 calorimeter towers and applies electron identification, a cluster overlap filter, particle isolation determination, jet reconstruction, particle separation and sorting.}
