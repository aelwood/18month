\section{Sensitivity to SUSY models with $13$~TeV Monte Carlo}
\label{sec:phys14Results}

The projected sensitivity to a variety of benchmark SUSY models was calculated with the full analysis work flow ran over $13$~TeV Monte Carlo. A binned likelihood method was utilised to calculate the $95\%$ Confidence Level (CL) limits on the signal strength. This was carried out for scenarios with $1/$fb and $10/$fb of data. The results are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:results}. In this case, a limit of $1.0$ is equivalent to excluding this model to the $95\%$ CL.
