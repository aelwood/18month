\section{Sensitivity to SUSY models with $13$~TeV Monte Carlo}
\label{sec:phys14Results}

The projected sensitivity to a variety of benchmark SUSY models was calculated with the full analysis work flow on $13$~TeV Monte Carlo. The models were chosen to have SUSY masses at the edge of the masses excluded in Run~1 with $20/$fb. A binned likelihood method was utilised to calculate the $95\%$ Confidence Level (CL) limits on the signal strength. This was carried out for scenarios with $1/$fb and $10/$fb of data. The results are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:results}. In this case, a limit of $1.0$ is equivalent to excluding this model to the $95\%$ CL, greater than $1.0$ means it will not be excluded. With only $1/$fb of data the limits are not very strong, not improving much on the results from Run~1 data \cite{susyRun1Twiki}. However, by $10/$fb, collectable by the end of 2015, there is a good degree of exclusion for most models.
