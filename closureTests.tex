\section{The determination of systematic errors in the $\alpha_T$ analysis}
\label{sec:closureTests}

As the $\alpha_T$ analysis aims to rely as little as data driven as possible, systematic errors are determined via a procedure of closure tests. Various background estimation methods and assumptions made within the analysis are probed by using different regions of closure tests to predict one another. The yield in an $N_{jet}$ and $H_T$ bin of region A, $N_{obs}^A$, is used to predict region B, $N_{pred}^B$, is calculated with:
\begin{equation}
  N_{pred}^B(H_T,N_{jet}) = \frac{N_{\rm MC}^
      B(H_T,N_{jet})}{N_{\rm MC}^A(H_T,N_{jet})} \times 
      N_{obs}^{\rm A}(H_T,N_{jet})   
\end{equation}
where we use the ratio of yields in Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the appropriate transfer factors. For a variety of tests, the ratio $\frac{N_{obs}-N_{pred}}{N_{pred}}$ is calculated. In each bin the systematic determined with the variance, $\sigma^2$ and the weighted mean of the points: 
\begin{equation}
\textrm{syst.} = \sqrt{\sigma^2+\textrm{mean}^2}.
\end{equation}
In the case of perfect closure, the mean and variance will be zero. However, due to the statistical limitations of the control samples, we can only determine the systematics to within a certain accuracy. Provided a suitable set of tests has been chosen, any bias in the data will always be covered by the systematic calculation with this method.
\\\\
Despite the fact that we do not have any $13$~TeV data, it is possible to investigate the degree of statistical power available to determine the systematics with simulation. Despite the fact that using simulation to predict itself will close by completion, the variance term contributes to the systematic. For a set of tests chosen to probe the control samples we are intending to use for background predictions, the closure tests in simulation can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:closureTests}.
\\\\
With the introduction of the $\cancel{H_T}$ event categorisation, ongoing development of the closure tests is ongoing to understand the effect of this variable on the systematic error calculation.
