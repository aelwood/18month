% Abstract -----------------------------------------------
\begin{abstract}
  \noindent
An all hadronic SUSY search for data taken by the CMS experiment during Run~2 of the LHC is described and motivated. The analysis utilises the $\alpha_T$ topological variable for multijet background control. New software developments required for the analysis of $13$~TeV data are outlined. Along with this, new analysis optimisations are discussed. These include binning in a missing energy variable and the update of reconstruction algorithms. It is found that with the new optimisations, the analysis should be sensitive to new SUSY parameter space with $10/$fb of data or less.
