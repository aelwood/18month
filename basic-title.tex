% Abstract -----------------------------------------------
\begin{abstract}
  \noindent
 This report outlines the motivation for the existence of Supersymmetry that is discoverable with the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The all hadronic SUSY search with the $\alpha_T$ variable is introduced. The Level 1 trigger upgrade at CMS for LHC Run 2 is also discussed, with emphasis on an upgrade to the hadronic jet algorithm. A new algorithm is simulated and the performance of various pileup subtraction techniques is analysed.
